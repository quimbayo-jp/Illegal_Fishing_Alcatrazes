## Description
We combined records of illegal fishing and literature trait data to test the effects of COVID-19 restrictions on illegal fishing activities inside and outside of Alcatrazes Archipelago (AA). This study reflects changes in the illegal fishing performed by Professional and recreational boats. 

Species richness and biomass data were collected between 2017 and 2021 from the infraction records of illegal fishing activities in the AA (n = 84), taken by the Environmental Police of the State of SÃ£o Paulo and officials of the Chico Mendes Institute for the Biodiversity Conservation (ICMBio). All records were obtained within the boundaries of the AA Conservation Unit, including the REVIS, Sapata island, and surrounding waters for further details see Figure 1.  

The trait data were collected from Quimbayo et al. (2019), except for the thermoregulation category, which was obtained from Pimiento et al. (2019). These two datasets contain numeric and categorical data on the illegal capture (columns) and trait aspects (columns) of marine species (rows) in one Marine Protected Area in Southwestern Brazil. Please refer to Table S2 in the electronic supplementary material of this article and Zenodo repository for further details.
