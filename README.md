## Description
We combined field and literature trait data to test the effects of COVID-19 restrictions on illegal fishing activity in the Alcatrazes Archipelago (AA). The functional approach allows the investigation of different traits collected during the pandemic period and reflects possible changes in the ecosystem functions due to the capture of predator species and macroalgal consumers.

Species and biomass data were collected between 2017 and 2021 from the infraction records of illegal fishing activities in the AA (n = 84), taken by the Environmental Police of the State of SÃ£o Paulo and officials of the Chico Mendes Institute for the Biodiversity Conservation (ICMBio). All records were obtained within the boundaries of the AA Conservation Unit, including the REVIS, Sapata island, and surrounding waters.  

The trait data were collected from Quimbayo et al. (2019), except for the thermoregulation category, which was obtained from Pimiento et al. (2019).
The two datasets contain numeric and categorical data on the illegal capture (columns) and trait aspects (columns) of marine species (rows) in one Marine Protected Area in Southwestern Brazil.

Data are provided in the form of comma-separated values files (csv), for each surveillance (sample unit). Please refer to Table XX in the electronic supplementary material of this article for further details.

If you use any dataset please cite the article above and the original reference for the data
